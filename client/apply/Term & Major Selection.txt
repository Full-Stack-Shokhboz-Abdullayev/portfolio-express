Theme: Education is the point at which we decide whether we love the world enough to assume responsibility for it, and by the same token save it from the ruin which except for renewal, except for the coming of the new and the young, would be inevitable.

The education is the first thing that humanity needed from the beginning of life in the earth to just light a fire until nowadays for making our life even easier. High and well education is the way to explore our undiscovered world, to make certain decisions and to be sure to be successful. With the help of teachers the young pupils will sharpen their knowledge and widen their outlook as well. Learning a lot but not acting is not the case to change our world to better side. After learning you absolutely want to make experience. Having experience you've already acted and somehow improved the world. As describing the education and knowledge there are lots of things to mention. So, let us just say, if we had some question on some topic, we can type to internet to get answer. Or if we need to visit somewhere that is located far from us then we can use our car for that. So why I mentioned those topics above?
I mean by that all the things that simplifies and improves our life experience did not come from themselves. Our life utilities came from the mind of high educated self improvers and life changers. So why not to be taught to get to the top of the mountain, the mountain of success?
