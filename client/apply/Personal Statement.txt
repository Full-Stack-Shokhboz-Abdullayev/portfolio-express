I'm a scalable self taught Junior Web Developer. I'm familiar with the top stack of technologies like Python programming language, JavaScript programming language, JavaScript frameworks: Vue.js, Express.js and CSS, Sass, HTML. My entire purpose is to get higher education from IT specialists to grow and learn more as a Software Engineer. In my life I have some struggles in finding a job. The reason why I have such difficulties is connected with bachelor's degree and experience. My main goal is to be successful man holding own business that makes boring boilerplate automated (business type of SaaS) and who is IT specialist. The goals came to my mind while firstly I was questioning my self about being usual person who lists instagram or facebook all day. From other side, secondly, I thought being the successful man who worked hard enough for his and his family's future.As i realized that for perfection I must move by my self, I choosed second one. As a Developer I solved many interesting but hard to solve problems with my intellect including Design and Quality. Those challenges made me stronger and get the initail taste of success.
