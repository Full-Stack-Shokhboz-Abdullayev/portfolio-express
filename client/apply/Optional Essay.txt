When I heard about University of Oregon I was interested in it. I read about it and I found the best fit thing for me. And truly it was scholarship. I did not find other Universities be so careful for students as University of Oregon. Because of my current money need for education I really loved this University. I'm planning to investigate my time not for just learning but as well as experiencing and supporting other students in University community. My support them can be IT technologies, I can share with them my knowledge and learning methodologies and having new skills from other students in the community.
