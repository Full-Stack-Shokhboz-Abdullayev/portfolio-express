Immigration is somehow the most popular topic for those 
who want to be relocated. There a few reasons to be understood. 
However, it can lead to different consequences throughout 
the process.

Immigration can make some people's life change to better.
Although "some" people's life changes to better side, another group 
of people argue that their life is becoming worse due to 
immigrants.

What are the reasons of immigration? Why people so 
thirsty about immigration? So, here the discussing starts.
When people see that country where they were born is not convenient 
for living they just decide to relocate themselves. Deep reasons for 
not finding own country is not as good as the country they would 
like to immigrate. As they hear and saw how beatiful life is in immigratable
country, they will be more open to relocate. Nevertheless, 
life is not as expected. After the relocation, they find that 
living is hard in every kind of country. It can lead lots of 
consequences. In other side, the people who live in immigration 
country suffer from the work deficit. That is why a lot of 
countries have requirements such as visa or english level. 

There are many reasons why society 
loves immigration. Above I represented some of them but not all.
What can fix our issue? That can be fixed if society loves 
their country and want to improve the living by themselves not 
just by relocating to another country.
