The pie graph illustrates the Energy Production
comparison from 1995 to 2005. 

Beginning in 1995 Gas, Coal, Petro production were roughly similar except few numbers.
They were the most used for Energy Production.
But Nuclear and Other resources were not as much as those three,
Gas, Coal and Petrol.

Final process in 2005 of the growth was slightly different.
Gas and Coal rose slowly between 30% - 31%.
But Petro went down to 19.55% whereas Nuclear and Other resources for Energy Production
increased their usage.

At starting point the Coal stayed the first by its usuality to the end.
Nuclear (6.40%) and Other (4.90%) resources jumped to 9% - 10% to the finish of the process.
Strangely Petro ended up by losing down significantly. 

As demonstrated the usage of environmental resources 
between 1995 and 2005 differntiate from each other with 3
certain things, Petro, Nuclear as well as Other resources.
