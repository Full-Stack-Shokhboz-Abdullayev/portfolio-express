The process illustration demonstrates the manufacture 
of bricks for the industry which is busy with buildings.

First of all, the digger machine digs the clays from 
clean earth without rocks. Next, the gathered clay is 
put into metal grid to make sure that is clean and out of rocks. 
If clay somehow holds rocks in itself then the rocks gathered for other purposes. 
After checking the clay with metal grid, clean sand falls down to 
roller that mixes the clay with water and delivers it 
either to wirecutter or mould. Cutted or put on mould mixture goes to 
drying oven for 24 - 48 hours. The process of drying is three staged: 
first oven kilns the bricks with over 200 to 980 celcius degree, 
second the same process as first with high - 870 to 1300 celcius degrees.
Finally, cooling chamber inside of oven makes bricks to rest.
After all of hard work bricks are gathered and ready to be delivered.
Lastly it is put into delivery car and is delivered. 

That's how the bricks' manufacture works.
