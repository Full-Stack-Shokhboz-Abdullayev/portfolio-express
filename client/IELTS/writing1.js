    The bar graph demonstrates the average participants 
    for education in Britain for males and females.
    
    In general the part-time education for Males
    between 1970 and 1971 starts with the huge 1000 thousands of Males.
    The numbers of Males in further part-time education fluctutated 
    until 1990/1991. Firstly it went in 1980/1981 but slightly increased in 1990/1991.

    The number of full-time Male students rose steadly starting from 1970/1971 
    below 200 thousands and finishing in 1990/1991 with above 200 thousands.

    Part-time Female students in other side began with 
    a below 800 and lower size compared to 
    part-time Male students. Finally finished 
    with above 1000 thousands of students, 
    more than part-time Males if compared.

    Secondly Full time Female students were not as much 
    females like part-time comparison. The number was the lowest in the 
    chart - over 80-90 thousands. 
    But suddenly it jumped to 200 thousands in 1980/1981 and
    rose quite little above from 200 thousands in 1990/1991.
