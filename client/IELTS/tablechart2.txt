The table graph illustrates the results of 
two surveys done with aspects of 
Education, Healthcare, Environment,
Shops, Employment and Transport 
in two different time, 
in 1980 and 2010 in percentage.

First of all the survey in 1980 shows how there 
is balance of all aspects. Despite of the percantages 
for Good column, there are some exceptions with Transport being the 
toppest in percentages of Bad column.

Turning to 2010, Education became improves for 
10 per cents. Healthcare went down a bit being 74 per cents.
Except Education and Transport aspect improvements are stable.

For Neither good nor Bad column the percentages lost for 
either good or bad column from 1980 to 2010.

Overall, all the aspects from two surveys 
are balanced and stable. Nonetheless some of them changed and
in our case not to bad side.
