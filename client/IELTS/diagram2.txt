The diagram represents the aluminium recycling in the UK.

Firstly people use aluminium cans and drop them into the garbage bag
The aluminium cans can be the cans which hold 
usual Coca Cola, Pepsi Cola or some soda drink and so on. 
Used and dropped into garbage bag aluminium cans are collected by
special aluminium collector machine or just a garbage collector.
Machine with cans deliver its collected alumina to another 
machine that cleans, sorts, shreds and compresses alumina.
Next step would be heating and melting. For that case, the other 
machine comes to work. After the process of melting, the melted aluminium 
mixture is rolled by rollers. Then the rolled and ready to produce 
aluminium forwarded to the section of recycling that turns the aluminium 
into the can. The last step is that the reproduced cans go to the branding section.
Different companies for instance Coca Cola or Pepsi Cola put different 
colours and logotypes of their own. And people reuse it again and again.

Overall, as the process demonstrates the reproducing appears to be large because the 
reused aluminium cans account for about 74 per cents of recycling and 
the rest of per cents are other in the UK specifically.
